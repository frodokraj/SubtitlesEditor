a different shape?

You're not even close.

808
00:41:12.208 --> 00:41:14.942

this universe but different?

810
00:41:16.279 --> 00:41:18.144
And you're Spider-Man
in that universe?

811
00:41:18.146 --> 00:41:20.047
But somehow traveled
to this universe,

812

Where's the collider?

848
00:42:32.253 --> 00:42:34.121

Where you going?

850
00:42:35.291 --> 00:42:36.956
When it runs again, I'll jump in

851
00:42:36.958 --> 00:42:38.391
and get back to my life.
You can't let them run it.

852
00:42:38.393 --> 00:42:39.960
I'm supposed to destroy it

853
00:42:39.962 --> 00:42:42.028
so it never runs again
or everyone's gonna die.

854
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:45.699
"Or everyone's gonna die."
That is what they always say.

855
00:42:45.701 --> 00:42:48.702
But there's always a little bit
of time before everybody dies

856
00:42:48.704 --> 00:42:50.070
and that's when I do
my best work.

to destroy the collider.

864

865

866
00:43:06.889 --> 00:43:09.023

I said...

867
00:43:09.025 --> 00:43:11.425
The collider created a portal
that brought me here.

868
00:43:11.427 --> 00:43:13.059
